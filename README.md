# Unity_ThreeAITechniques

Personal proyect about the most used <b>Ad-Hoc Behavior Authoring</b> techniques implemented in <b>Unity 2019.4.8f1</b>, <b>MonoBehaviour oriented</b>.
That includes <b>Finite State Machines</b>, <b>Behaviour Trees</b> and <b>Utility based AI</b>.
Done for my undergraduate thesis about AI at U-Tad.

This was a designer's attempt to code all these AIs.
